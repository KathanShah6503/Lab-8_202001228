#Error screenshot is image.png

I have analyzed 3 files from various git repositories. Here is the explanation of the errors we found.

1. Practical-Python
--> This file had no errors.

2. Captcha-Generator.py
--> As per shown in the image, this file has two errors but there are not really any errors as the error was because of the file missing since we have only checked one file.

3. Python-mini-project.py
--> This file has two error of not including library.
